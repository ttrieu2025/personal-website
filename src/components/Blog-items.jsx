    comment: "Some mathematicians and physicists argue that Euler's Identity or Einstein's Mass-Energy Equivalence Equation is the most elegant equation that humans have ever discovered. However, I stand with Maxwell's Equations on this topic because of the beauty in their mathematical formulation as well as their applications in engineering disciplines. While a passion for designing technology is a reason for me to pursue Electrical Engineering, studying the language of these equations is what keeps the fire alive.",
